# Learning WebSocket

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

## Super quick demo setup

Triple-click to select the whole command below: (and copy it into CLI and run it)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hchiam/learning-websocket.git && cd learning-websocket && yarn && nodemon
```

Or if you don't have [`yarn`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-yarn) installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hchiam/learning-websocket.git && cd learning-websocket && npm install && nodemon
```

You can then open <http://localhost:8080> in multiple tabs to see live chat working locally in localhost.
